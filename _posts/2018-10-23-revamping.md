Just a little notice. I'm currently revamping my blog so it can be saves and runs on a static system. It will be ideal to make sure traffic doesn't become an issue, ever. And free hosting via Github Pages.

Jekyll is a bit of a learning curve, but I'm making progress. It should be back to normal soon. 
With a new look.
I kept my most popular post to date [here](https://ronaldlangeveld.com/deleting-facebook) so it should remain accessable.
