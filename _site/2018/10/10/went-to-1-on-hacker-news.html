                    <p>On Sunday evening I decided to once and for all kill my Facebook account. But I didn‚Äôt want to lose everything so I managed to back up everything.</p>

<p>Instead of just doing that, I decided to document most of the process and do a little <a href="https://ronaldlangeveld.com/deleting-facebook">blog post</a> about it, just for incase an old friend or acquaintance is looking for me, which they can google me and they‚Äôll probably find this blog and a whole list of updated ways to contact me. And then they‚Äôll know, ‚ÄúAh, Ronald deleted his account, he didn‚Äôt unfriend me.‚Äù - no heavy vibes üíù</p>

<p>As with most of my blog posts, for fun, I share it on Hacker News along with Twitter &amp; Reddit. I usually get a few views from it.</p>

<p>However this time was a little bit different.</p>

<p>About 20 minutes after I posted it, I suddenly saw my traffic surging fast and my server slowed down like crazy - but it luckily stayed live.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs when it hit me. My blog post is on the front page of Hacker News. OH MY GOSH!</p>

<p>About an hour after I posted it, it received over 3000 hits already.</p>

<p>First it was at #3.</p>

<p>But it quickly got ahead of the rest.</p>

<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/cinemakers/image/upload/v1540363159/blog/Screenshot-2018-10-08-at-08.52.24-3.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Ahead of Nvidia, Google and NY Times (classic headline though) OH MY GOSH 2.0</p>

<p>And it literally hovered around the top 3 for a few hours, till it started moving down. By the evening it was just over #10. And then it slowly faded away.</p>

<p>I mean, it‚Äôs not suppose to be a big deal. It‚Äôs not like I got money for it or anything tangible. But, the feeling that I something I posted actually got that much attention by over <a href="https://simpleanalytics.io/ronaldlangeveld.com">11,000 people in a day</a>. That‚Äôs quite a cool feeling.</p>

<p>It also gave my servers a good stress test. My blog runs on <a href="https://ghost.org">Ghost</a>, with Sqlite (as opposed to MySQL which they recommend) and it managed to stay up. I think a bit more RAM and CPU would‚Äôve ensured that it stayed fast all the time - but still, it didn‚Äôt crash and it just kept serving page requests. At some point I was getting over 50 hits per second. That‚Äôs a lot of traffic for a $5 server.</p>

<p>Overall, It was a cool experience! Hopefully something like this happens again - and with one of my projects, or clients‚Äô websites.</p>
